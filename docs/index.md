# What is ratgdo?
ratgdo is a WiFi control board for your garage door opener that works over your *local network* using ESPHome, HomeKit or MQTT.

It works with virtually any residential Chamberlain or Liftmaster manufactured garage door opener and also offers basic support for other brands which use dry contacts to control the door.

It can control the door and report back the actual status of the door (closed, opening, open, closing). For "yellow learn button" Security + 2.0 door openers, the obstruction sensors, light, wireless lockout and even motion sensing are also integrated.

# About ratgdo 
ratgdo gives you **local** MQTT / ESPHome / HomeKit or dry contact control plus full status feedback for your Chamberlain/LiftMaster garage door opener. Security+ 2.0 uses an obfuscated serial signal to control the door opener's open/close and light functions, which makes it impossible to use Shelly One, Go Control, Insteon I/O linc or any other dry contact relay device to control the door. ratgdo supports virtually all residential garage door openers made by Chamberlain, and also supports other manufacturers through dry contact control.

ratgdo is a hardware control board that wires to your door opener's terminals. The firmware allows you to control the door with MQTT or ESPHome over your local WiFi network which can be used to integrate directly with NodeRED or Home Assistant, eliminating the need for another "smart" device. WiFi is **not** required if you wish to only use the dry contact interface.

ratgdo is *not* a cloud device and does *not* require a subscription service. The firmware is open source and free for anyone to use.

# ratgdo Firmware
* ESPHome - best for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io), Chowmainsoft's [Control4](https://chowmain.software/drivers/control4-ratgdo), [Nice/Elan](https://chowmain.software/drivers/elan-ratgdo), &amp; [Crestron](https://chowmain.software/drivers/crestronhome-ratgdo), Finite Lab's [Control4](https://github.com/finitelabs/control4-esphome) integrations, MQTT Integrations using a custom yaml

## Version 2.5
Version 2.5 adds support for Security + 1.0 openers as well as standard dry contact openers. Extra wiring terminals for your wall control panel and obstruction sensors have been added which simplifies the installation. Security +1.0 requires an 889LM / 041A7928-3MC wall control panel. If you do not have an 889LM / 041A7928-3MC, ratgdo offers an emulation mode but it will interfere with your wall control's functions. dry contact control mode can be used with security +1.0 openers as a fall back. 

## Version 2.0
Version 2.0 eliminates the need to solder to your garage door's logic board. It works with all Security + 2.0 openers, including 45 series logic boards. 

Version 2.0 also provides discrete light on/off commands.
